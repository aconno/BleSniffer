/**
 * Creates a layout that contains layout inflated from layout resource specified by [layoutResourceId]
 * parameter and an instance of [HexKeyboardView] that is attached to bottom of the created layout. Then,
 * it sets the created layout as receiver's content view.
 *
 * There is also optional parameter [wrapContentInScrollView] that specifies if the inflated layout
 * should be wrapped in a scroll view, so that it does not happen that part of the inflated layout is
 * covered by [HexKeyboardView] and therefore can not be accessed while the [HexKeyboardView] is displayed.
 * This parameter can be set to false if the layout that is to be inflated already contains a scroll view
 * (i.e. it itself handles scrolling it's content) or if the layout height is not big (so that the whole
 * layout content can be visible on the screen while the [HexKeyboardView] is displayed) or if it is
 * not important if the part of the inflated layout is inaccessible when the [HexKeyboardView] is
 * displayed.
 *
 * The purpose of this method is to be able to provide [HexKeyboardView] for [HexEditText][com.aconno.hexinputlib.ui.editor.HexEditText]
 * without adding it manually into activity content view. But since this method wraps the specified layout
 * into a new layout, this could lead do some performance issues or maybe even to some bugs, so use this
 * method with caution. This method is recommended to be used only for simple layouts, but if there is
 * some more complex layout, then the best option is to manually add a [HexKeyboardView] into the layout
 * resource.
 *
 * @receiver activity that needs a hex keyboard view added into it's content view
 * @param layoutResourceId  id of a layout resource to inflate layout from and set it into receiver's content view
 * @param wrapContentInScrollView true if the inflated layout (specified by [layoutResourceId] parameter) should
 *   be wrapped into a scroll view
